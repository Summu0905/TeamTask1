# TeamTask1
This is the first task.
Sumaiya Created a Repository named "TeamTask1".
Sourabh and Praveen cloned the repository.
Sourabh created a file named "main.cpp" and implemented fibonocci series using recursion with the time complexity 2^n.
Sumaiya reviwed the code and created a new pull request.
Praveen implemented a new approach for the code with the time complexity O(n) through the pull request he merged the main file.
Then Sumaiya and Sourabh reviwed the implementation.
